# Talismans
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 565 3.0

---
An item with the talisman trait is a magical charm, gem, stone, or other small object affixed to armor, a shield, or a weapon (called the affixed item). Each talisman holds a sliver of combat knowledge or magical energy that can be unleashed for a momentary boost of power or enhanced ability. Many talismans can be activated as a free action when you use a particular action or activity. A talisman is a consumable item and has the talisman trait.

You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate a talisman attached to it. Once activated, a talisman burns out permanently, usually crumbling into a fine dust.

## Affixing a Talisman
*Source* Core Rulebook pg. 565 3.0

Each talismanâ€™s stat block indicates the type of item it can be affixed to. Affixing or removing requires using the [Affix a Talisman](../../../Activities/Affix%20a%20Talisman.md) activity. A single talisman can be affixed to only one item at a time, and an item can have only one talisman affixed to it at a time.
